# Country Capital Quiz

This is a country capital quiz app I have create in which the user needs to guess the name of the capital of a particular country. It displays a question and the user will have 6 options to choose for the correct answer.

This app is developed using React and TypeScript and is also responsive.

I have also written some test and integrated them with GitHub Actions to ensure everything works as expected.
